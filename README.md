# Patient similarity
Patient similarity measurement is a fundamental and important task in healthcare and can help you make decisions without the additional time and cost of a physician. Measuring a pair of patients based on historical information can be applied to a variety of medical applications, such as cohort analysis and personalized drug recommendations. Healthcare data EHR has high complexity, irregular, and sequential characteristics. So how to get patient similarity properly becomes a major problem. Recently, studies have been conducted mainly to measure similarities between patients through supervised learning.
